# ZMeta Refinement Handoff Notes

Status date: 2026-05-07

This note is the quick resume point for the current ZMeta refinement effort. The full task history and deferred issue register are in `docs/zmeta_refinement_worklog.md`.

## Current Position

The semantic contract has been audited, rewritten, and crosswalked against the current implementation stack. The locked v1.0 baseline was verified, and no S1-01B targeted schema implementation task is currently needed. Profile projection preservation has been implemented and audited as sidecar conformance tooling without changing v1.0 schema or event vocabulary. The extension registry has been implemented and audited. The conformance class manifest and claim model have been implemented and audited without changing schemas or making new vocabulary valid. Encoding-negative validation has been implemented and audited for compact CBOR and protobuf invalid-after-decode paths.

The next active implementation item is:

**S1-06A - Profile Precision / Quantization Policy Floors Plan Only**

## Current Decisions

- The semantic contract is authoritative; implementation surfaces must preserve it.
- v1.0 remains locked.
- Do not add v1.1.0 or future concepts to v1.0.
- S1-01A found no schema-enforceable v1.0 gap requiring S1-01B.
- Profile projection preservation is now covered by a sidecar field catalog and source/projected conformance pairs.
- Compact Profile L and protobuf remain encoding projections; both must decode to canonical JSON before schema, policy, and projection checks.
- Existing strict conformance remains stable by default. Projection checks are explicit via `tools/validate_projection.py` or `tools/validate_conformance.py --strict --profile-projection`.
- The extension registry should be implemented as spec-owned artifacts:
  `spec/extension-registry.md` and `spec/extension-registry.yaml`.
- Existing v1.1.0 extension concepts should remain `experimental` by default
  until a version/release decision promotes them.
- Reserved/proposed concepts are not valid event vocabulary.
- Registry validation is standalone and opt-in through
  `tools/validate_extension_registry.py` or
  `tools/validate_conformance.py --strict --extension-registry`.
- D-006 is closed after S1-03C verified the registry implementation.
- D-011 remains open. S1-03C added a validator/test guard so `TAKEOFF` cannot
  appear in current schema vocabulary unnoticed, but the crosswalk typo still
  needs a narrow docs cleanup.
- Conformance classes organize implementation claims and required evidence.
  They do not create semantics or make future classes claimable.
- Conformance class validation is standalone and opt-in through
  `tools/validate_conformance_classes.py` or
  `tools/validate_conformance.py --strict --conformance-classes`.
- `ZMETA-COT-PROJECTION` is recorded as `partially_implemented` pending a
  shared adapter conformance harness.
- Example claim files use `contract_hash: pending_D-002`; D-002 remains open.
- S1-04C verified the conformance class implementation. D-008 is closed.
- S1-05A planned encoding-negative validation only. Compact/protobuf remain
  wire projections, and S1-05B should prove invalid decoded compact/protobuf
  events cannot bypass schema, policy, projection, gateway, CLI, registry, or
  conformance expectations.
- S1-05B implemented encoding-negative validation as an opt-in suite. Default
  `--strict` remains unchanged. The compact/protobuf classes now include
  encoding-negative evidence, but no new conformance class was added.
- S1-05C verified encoding-negative validation. D-007 is closed. Remaining
  policy-specific examples from S1-05A are optional future breadth, not an
  encoding-layer bypass gap.

## Next Work Queue

1. **S1-06A - Profile Precision / Quantization Policy Floors Plan Only**
   - Plan mission/profile-specific precision floors and packet-budget policy for
     Profile M/L.

2. **Human decisions before class activation / later claim hardening**
   - Whether current class statuses should be `implemented` or `active`.
   - Whether claim files should require captured test output artifacts or only
     command/result summaries.
   - Whether claim files should require contract hash immediately or allow a
     nullable field until D-002 is resolved.
   - Whether generic adapter classes should wait for a shared adapter harness.
   - Whether `ZMETA-COT-PROJECTION` should remain partial until that harness
     exists.
   - Whether v1.1.0 concepts remain `experimental` or any should be promoted.
   - Whether registry validation should remain opt-in or become part of strict
     conformance after the format stabilizes.
   - How to represent vendor/private namespaces and classified/restricted names.
   - Whether companion artifacts stay as a registry category or split into a
     separate manifest later.
   - Whether to clean the crosswalk `TAKEOFF` typo in the next narrow docs
     cleanup task or leave it deferred.
   - Whether encoding-negative fixtures should store malformed bytes as hex,
     base64, or generated-at-test-time inputs.
   - Whether to add a future `ZMETA-ENCODING-NEGATIVE-VALIDATION` class or fold
     the suite into existing compact/protobuf classes.
   - Whether `--encoding-negative` should remain opt-in indefinitely or later
     join strict release conformance.

3. **Deferred issue cleanup**
   - D-007 Encoding Negative Validation Gap is closed.
   - D-008 Conformance Class Manifest Missing is closed.
   - D-009 v1.0/v1.1 Observation Extension Boundary Needs Explicit Tests.
   - D-010 Profile Precision / Quantization Policy Floors.
   - D-011 Crosswalk TAKEOFF Mention Cleanup.

4. **Later versioned semantic branches**
   - Markings/releasability.
   - Integrity, signing, anti-replay, mesh trust, and quarantine.
   - MODEL_STATUS / assurance and drift monitoring.
   - UAS identity and behavioral trust.
   - Track lifecycle extensions.
   - Coalition export and cross-domain guard metadata.
   - Compute status and degraded runtime behavior.

## Guardrails for Next Prompt

- Do not change schemas unless the prompt explicitly moves into a schema implementation item.
- Do not recompute release/contract hashes until the stack-hardening branch is intentionally ready.
- Do not make v1.1.0 or future concepts valid under `zmeta_version: "1.0"`.
- Keep profile projection checks pairwise and external to v1.0 event payloads.
- Keep registry work plan-first and branch-scoped. A registry entry alone does
  not make vocabulary valid.
- Keep conformance class work evidence-driven. A class record alone does not
  prove an implementation claim.
- Document any newly discovered issues in the deferred issue register in `docs/zmeta_refinement_worklog.md`.

## Verification State

Most recent validation after S1-05C:

```powershell
python tools\validate_encoding_negative.py --compact conformance\encoding-negative\compact-must-fail.jsonl --protobuf conformance\encoding-negative\protobuf-must-fail.jsonl --gateway conformance\encoding-negative\gateway-must-fail.jsonl
python tools\validate_conformance.py --strict
python tools\validate_conformance.py --strict --profile-projection
python tools\validate_conformance.py --strict --profile-projection --extension-registry
python tools\validate_conformance.py --strict --profile-projection --extension-registry --conformance-classes
python tools\validate_conformance.py --strict --profile-projection --extension-registry --conformance-classes --encoding-negative
python tools\validate_conformance_classes.py --manifest conformance\conformance_classes.yaml
python tools\validate_conformance_classes.py --manifest conformance\conformance_classes.yaml --claims conformance\claims\example-reference-gateway.yaml conformance\claims\example-core-producer.yaml
python -m pytest -q gateway\tests\test_encoding_negative_validation.py gateway\tests\test_compact_negative_decode.py gateway\tests\test_protobuf_negative_decode.py
python -m pytest
git diff --check
```

Result: validation passed through full pytest.
Encoding-negative validator result: `encoding negative ok total=49`.
Focused encoding-negative tests passed: `22 passed`.
Full pytest result: `295 passed`.
`git diff --check` passed with CRLF conversion warnings only.
